# SuperDirt Voltage

A small set of SuperDirt synths and Tidal helpers to control modular synths. No
MIDI required!

**2023 updates:**

- nDef synths
- Added `saw`, `lfo` triggered LFOs
- `amp` now controls the scale of `gate`, `voltage`, `saw`, `ar`, and `lfo`

---

### nDef

Defining `nDef` synths provide a constant signal between cycles and
instructions. You will need to define a separate `nDef` for each instance you
would like to use.

```c
Ndef(\cv_np).source = \nPitch;
Ndef(\cv_np).play(0);
~dirt.soundLibrary.addSynth(\cv, (play: {
    var latency = (~latency ? 0);
    var freq = ~freq;
    var channel = ~channel;
    var portamento = ~portamento;

    Ndef(\cv_np).wakeUp; // make sure the Ndef runs

    thisThread.clock.sched(latency - 0.025, {
        Ndef(\cv_np).set(\portamento, portamento);
        Ndef(\cv_np).set(\channel, channel);
        Ndef(\cv_np).set(\freq, freq);
    });
})
);
```

After adding or evaluating the above in SuperCollider, you can use them like:

```haskell
-- you can select pitch by number
d1 $ n "20" # s "cv"

-- or by note name 
d1 $ n "c3" # s "cv"

-- change channel output and/or portamento
d1 $ n "c3 f2" # s "cv" # channel 1 # portamento 0.5
```

---

### Simple

The following synths, while easier to use, create a new cv instance each cycle.
This can result in short gaps/breaks in between cycles. You can use `nDef`'s
above to remedy this.

### Pitch, with octave quantisation

```haskell
-- change notes per octave on each cycle
d1 $ pitch "0 10 8 1" # octave "<12 31 8>" # x 1
```

`pitch` allows a pattern of note values. `octave` sets the amount of notes per
octave. The pitch and scale values will be converted to `1v/octave`. Both
`pitch` and `octave` can be sequenced for some microtonal madness...

`glide` accepts a strengh (in semitones, relative to scale), a rate (in step
length).

```haskell
-- glide to pitch
d1 $ pitch "0 10 8 1" # scale "<12 31 8>" # x 1 # glide 12 0.5
```

### Gate

```haskell
-- sequence gate inputs
d2 $ gate "0 1 0 0 1 1 1" # x 2
```

`gate` will take a 0/1 pattern and return +5v signals for the `1` values. Use
`-1` if you need a -5v.

### Voltage automation

```haskell
-- create stepped automation
d3 $ volt "1 0.2 0.5 -0.2" # x 3
```

`volt` will allow you to sequence voltages however you like.

### ADSR/AR

```haskell
--- adsr
d4 $ adsr 0 0.2 1 0.2 # x 4
```

There is also just an `ar` helper too, which has a default D and S value.

```haskell
-- create ar
d5 $ struct "t f t t" # ar 0 0.5 # x 5
```

```haskell
-- patternise ar
d5 $ struct "t f t t" # ar (range 0.1 1 sine) "<0 0.4>" # x 5
```

In the above example, the attack time would grow for each triggered envelope
over course of the cycle.

### Sine LFO

This will create an sine waveform, the sine will restart with each cycle, which
gives a neat synced/trigger effect for modulations.

```haskell
d6 $ lfo 0.5 # x 6
```

### Saw LFO

This will create a sawtooth waveform, the sawtooth will restart with each cycle,
which gives a neat synced/trigger effect for modulations.

```haskell
d6 $ saw 0.5 # x 6
```

### Clock

```haskell
-- clock cv output
d6 $ clock # x 6
```

`clock` will output a clock cv, which matches the bpm of your tidal project. You
can `slow` / `fast` this as well.

### Amp

Using the `amp` modifier in Tidal Cycles will scale the output of `gate`,
`voltage`, `saw`, `ar`, and `lfo`. Awesome for creating more suble modulations.

```haskell
d6 $ saw 0.5 # x 6 # amp 0.3
```

---

### How to use

**These require a DC-coupled sound card.**

Add the `voltage.scd` synths to your active SuperDirt synth definitions.

Evaluate the `voltage.tidal` definitions after starting Tidal. These can also be
added to your Tidal startup file.

In the above examples, `x` maps to a channel on your audio card. If you have an
8 output audio card, the `x` will likely be 0-7. If you are using an aggregate
device, please refer to your Audio settings.
